# CtCI-6th-cpp
This is the set of C++ solution and test codes for "Cracking the Coding Interview 6th Edition."

If you would like to test your program like competitive programming, this is what I made for ðŸš€.

Each problem has a directory, and there are three C++ files "problem.cpp", "solution.cpp", and "tester.cpp".

- In the "problem.cpp", You can type your own solution, and it will automatically test the code when you compile and execute it.
- In the "solution.cpp", You can find several solutions optimized into C++ from Java code in the book. You can also run it "problem.cpp".
- In the "tester.cpp", there are test codes using C++ unittest framework, "Catch2".
