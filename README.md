# CtCI-6th-cpp
This is the set of C++ solution and test codes for "Cracking the Coding Interview 6th Edition."

If you would like to test your program like competitive programming, this is what I made for ðŸš€.

## How to use it

Each problem has a directory, and there are three C++ files "problem.cpp", "solution.cpp", and "tester.cpp".

- In the "problem.cpp", You can type your own solution, and it will automatically test the code when you compile and execute it.
- In the "solution.cpp", You can find several solutions optimized into C++ from Java code in the book. You can also run it "problem.cpp".
- In the "tester.cpp", there are test codes using C++ unittest framework, "Catch2".

## About Coding
Most structure of programs follow the book's Java code, but some points are different.
- The Java's camelCase is changed into snake_case. 
- The name of the main function has the problem's name. This is not consistent with the book's code. For example, problem 1.1's name of the main function is "isUniqueChars" in the book, but it is "is_unique" in this directory.
